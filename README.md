## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for creating the structure of the web page
- **CSS** – for styling the app and making it visually appealing
- **JavaScript** – for adding interactivity and fetching data from the API
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – to get live weather information

## How I Made This Project

1. Designed the layout using HTML and styled it with CSS for a clean and centered user interface.
2. Connected an input box and button that allows users to type a city name and trigger the weather fetch.
3. Used JavaScript’s `fetch()` method to send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and get weather data based on the city entered.
4. Parsed the API response to extract specific weather details like temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed.
5. Displayed the data dynamically in the browser using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
6. Added error handling to show messages when a city is not found or input is left empty.
